# Healthy-Mushroom
This project is a full-stack web application designed to determine whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on specific characteristics like cap shape, cap surface, cap color, and odor. The application combines machine learning with a user-friendly frontend to help people identify mushrooms safely and easily.
